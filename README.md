# Welcome

This is my project page for The Odin Project's [HTML/CSS Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).

I've attempted to recreate Google's search homepage.

## What I did well

1. I figured out a lot of placement, sizing and pseudo-selectors (:hover) to recreate some of the effects of the homepage.
2. The styling of some of the elements (mainly buttons/input and border radius) went better than I expected.
3. I started the document by just putting the content in place and used mostly semantic markup instead of littering my page with divs.

## What I need to work on

1. I did not approach this as mobile first. It is also not responsive.
2. I used floats in my header/footer where I should have used flexbox and/or grid to place items. I need to go back through the tutorials for Flexbox/Grid.
3. I did not vertically align the text and the avatar image in the header.
4. The page layout seems weird. The header, container and footer sections seem much larger on inspect than they should be. I assume it's a byproduct of not implementing flexbox/grid.
5. I could not figure out the apps dashboard icon thing. I was going to use a screenshot image placeholder, but it was blurry. I think there's an SVG or CSS shapes solution.

## Where I'll be going from here

I'll be revisiting the Flexbox/Grid tutorials and will refactor this project.
